## Fintech_Finder    


In this project I was tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable the customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals that they had hired with cryptocurrency.

In this assignment we have 4 fintech professionals (Lane, Ash, Kendall & Jane). The sidebar shows the address of the sender, finance professionals address, number of hours worked and the ETH transferred.
